#SP500-Forecasting-Using-Financial-And-News-Data

For our CS6375.502 (Machine Learning) final project, we decided the
problem statement to be weekly up/down forecasting of S&P 500
stock price movement using machine learning techniques. The
reason for choosing SPY is its high liquidity on contracts. We
want to predict the lower bound of the time span for choosing the
best expiration date for a bullish call. As the underlying decision
factor the price forecasting will be used as the contract price is
directly related to the underlying stock price. Our aim is to create
a probabilistic guarantee of return. In this report, we present
a detailed description of our proposed systems, experiments
conducted, and analyze the results as well. Our stacking based
ensemble model which was created using support vector machine
achieved an f1-score of 57% on the testing data
